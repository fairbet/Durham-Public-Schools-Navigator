## HackDuke 2016: Education Track
Finding a school for future generations is often a challenging yet critical process. A simple google search might return thousands of  unorganized or even irrelevant results, making the process even more time-consuming. We aim at streamlining the process by presenting open data published by NC Department of Public Instruction in an intuitive and interactive way with the power of Google Maps.
